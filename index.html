        <p>Hello my name is Joshua Arnold Beckford. I have been programming since Grade 10. I am now 24 years old so I have
            been programming for roughly 8 years. I started programming in with Visual Basic's, HTML and CSS. In Grade 12
            I learned Java but my programming level really changed when I went to University where I took 3 Computer Science
            courses. I took Java 1 & 2 and Introduction to C and Linux. I am also completing a University certificate coarse
            in Full Stack Web Development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Coding is my passion and my hobby I love to do it and live for it. I try my best to overcome and succeed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am really excited to be part of a friendly class lead by our instructor and TA's that are professionals in the
            industry.
